# GMeetPPTRipper
Takes and crops Images of Powerpoint Presentations from Google Meet Recordings using ffmpeg. These can be used to make PDFs of the PPT.
This is the script file. Please place ffmpeg.exe in the same folder, along with video files (mp4 only) and it automatically creates the folders with images.
